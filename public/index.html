<h1>The Best Movies According to Manu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1) Whiplash</h3>
<p>A movie that perfectly resembles how obsession can and will completely destrow a passionate man.</p>
<h3>2) Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</h3>
<p>My favorite Tarintino movie. The authentic feeling of what it was like in LA during the 60's,
along with rewriting history, from a tragic and disturbing murder, to a heroic wish of what could have happned</p>
<h3>3) The Batman</h3>
<p>The most accurate interpretation of the greatest hero of all time. Batman.</p>
